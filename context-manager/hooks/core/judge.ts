/** The judge prompt (verbatim from the original build spec) with the eight evidence placeholders. */
export const JUDGE_PROMPT = `You are auditing THIS session for wasted context and wasted time. The transcript above is your own: read it for intent — what the user asked for, what you were told, what you already decided. The blocks below are the only evidence of what actually ran; nothing outside them exists for this audit.

Answer four narrow questions. What repeated: which behaviours have already happened more than once, separated by other work, or have you said you will keep doing — and what should be done instead? Where the time and the context went: which of the largest sinks below are repetition or work nobody asked for rather than the work this session needed. What is going in circles: the same failing command retried with no diagnostic step between, read/edit/read on one path with nothing finished, an edit failing on one path over and over. What was out of proportion: which spawned work — an agent, a workflow stage, a review or verification round — cost far more than what it produced, or did what a shell step would have done (AGENTS below).

You are writing an interruption. Every finding can put a card in front of the user mid-work and can become a standing instruction that constrains you for the rest of the session. A wrong finding costs more than a missed one: it interrupts correct work, teaches a bad rule, and makes the user distrust the next card. Prefer silence to a guess. \`"findings": []\` is a correct and common answer.

## Rules
1. Report behaviours, not incidents. A finding needs two unexcused occurrences of the same behaviour separated by other work (see Counting), or one occurrence plus your own stated intent to keep doing it ("I'll re-run the suite after each fix"). A single expensive call is never a finding.
2. \`evidence\`: row ids copied from the LEDGER \`id\` column (\`r12\`), or \`turn:<n>\` where \`<n>\` is a \`turn\` number printed in TURNS, or \`agent:<alias>\` where \`<alias>\` is an \`alias\` printed in AGENTS — turn and agent handles only for findings whose \`signature\` is null. Copy ids exactly; never renumber, abbreviate or reformat one. A finding with an id that is not in these blocks is discarded whole. STATS lines and \`~\` summary lines carry no id: use them for counts and history in \`why\` (they are the whole session, counted for you), never cite them as evidence, and never assume the oldest full row is the first occurrence.
3. \`signature\`: copy \`key\` character-for-character from one LEDGER row and \`tool\` from that same row. Keys are cut at 200 characters — copy the cut, never complete a command from memory. A pair that does not match a row discards the finding. Choose a key that only the wasteful version of the call carries; when no single recurring call carries the behaviour, use \`"signature": null\`.
4. Reuse ids. If KNOWN PATTERNS already names the behaviour, return that exact \`id\` with fresh evidence. The same command, file or lens under a different slug or category is the same waste: scan KNOWN PATTERNS and DECISIONS before minting an id.
5. Respect DECISIONS. A \`keep\` silences that behaviour under any id, category or wording for this session, and a kept occurrence may not be cited as evidence inside another finding. A behaviour kept in a previous session may be reported only with three or more occurrences and confidence 0.8 or higher. A \`steer\` or \`kill\` may be reported again only if it recurred after that turn: cite rows whose \`turn\` is greater and say so in \`why\`.
6. \`kind\`: one sentence of at most 120 characters, starting exactly \`Claude keeps \`, naming the concrete thing — the command, the file, the agent.
7. \`alternative\`: one imperative sentence of at most 200 characters addressed to Claude. It is sent to Claude verbatim, may be re-sent with every prompt for the rest of the session, and may be written into CLAUDE.md, so it must be safe to obey in situations you did not see: scope it ("run only the tests covering the files you changed, then the full suite once per phase"), never ban a capability outright ("never run the test suite"). If you cannot phrase the fix without forbidding something legitimate, drop the finding.
8. \`why\`: one or two sentences of evidence — how many times, what changed between occurrences, what the transcript shows — and the legitimate explanation you considered and what rules it out. Never a count or a cost these blocks do not contain.
9. At most six findings, at most three with \`signature: null\`, ordered by the sum of \`chars\` over the rows cited, largest first. Six is a ceiling, not a target; never split one behaviour into two findings.

## Counting — what makes two occurrences a repeat
- Separated by other work. Two occurrences of the same behaviour count as two decisions when at least one other row sits between them — an edit, a read, another command — whether in the same turn or a later one; a run after an edit is a second decision, not a second call in one batch — whether it is excused is the category's own question. Calls issued together with nothing between them are one batch and count once: a parallel set of Reads, or a fan-out of subagents launched at once, is one choice however wide. Breadth is one decision; weight is not: every stage of a workflow (each \`label\` in AGENTS) is a decision of its own, and the same role recurring stage after stage — a check loop per chunk, a review round after every fix — is a repeat.
- Both unexcused. An occurrence the "Never report" list excuses does not count and may not be cited. Subtract the excused ones first; if fewer than two remain, there is no finding. A baseline suite run at the start plus the check before a commit is zero findings.
- Same side of a compaction. TURNS lists the turns where a compaction happened; content dropped by it must be re-acquired. Count only occurrences after the last compaction.
- Same behaviour, not the same shape. For a signature finding that means the same \`key\`; two Read keys differing only in \`:offset-limit\` are different slices, not a repeat. For a null-signature finding you must name one behaviour and show it in each cited turn; do not staple unrelated expensive turns together.
- Agents are loops of their own. The \`agent\` column names the loop; a repeat inside one agent's rows counts exactly like a repeat in the main loop, and the main loop re-doing after an agent returns what that agent's rows show it already did (the same Read key, the same check) is a repeat across loops.
- Short ledgers. With fewer than about 12 rows or fewer than 4 turns, report only behaviours with three or more surviving occurrences, or one plus explicit stated intent.
- The legitimacy ladder. A sink needed once is nothing, however large. A sink repeated because its inputs changed between the runs — an edit, an install, a migration — is nothing. A sink repeated with nothing changed between, or work the transcript shows nobody asked for, is a finding, and the excuse you considered is written into \`why\`.

## Categories — the nine names are the whole enum; the cues are examples and \`kind\` is free text
- execution — the whole suite/build/typecheck after each edit; re-running a check with nothing edited since it last passed; the same failing command retried with no diagnostic step between; \`sleep\` polling or a watch/dev server run as a blocking call (\`bg\` absent, large \`ms\`). Not: a run after any intervening edit, install, migration or config change; the session's baseline run; broad verification after shared code changed; the last check before a commit; one retry of a transient failure. The error text is not in these blocks, so you cannot claim two failures were the same failure.
- reading — the same path read again with nothing having changed it; whole-file reads where a range would do (\`trunc\`); unfiltered log/diff/verbose dumps (large \`chars\`, \`persist=\`); a Bash read of a file that is then Read again; wide greps with no path scope and no edit after them. Not: a read after your own edit or after any command that could have rewritten the file; a read after a compaction; paging (a second read at a new offset, especially after \`trunc\`); the first look at an unfamiliar file or log; a row flagged \`dedup\` (core charged nothing).
- production — whole-file rewrites for small changes (\`+a/-d\` near the file's size); edits that cancel out; tests or docs nobody asked for; the same Edit failing on one path over and over. Not: a new file; a rewrite the user asked for; call-site updates the change requires.
- behavior — read/edit/read oscillation with nothing finished; approach flip-flops; repeating what the user already corrected. Not: read-edit-verify cycles that are the working method, or a step that depends on the previous result.
- communication — turns with \`calls 0\` and large \`answerChars\` that restate the plan or recap finished work; stopping to ask what the transcript, the repo or your instructions already answer; an \`ask\` row that held the turn for minutes while no agent ran (no rows between it and the next prompt) and whose options carried a recommended default (\`recommended\`) — proceed on the default and ask beside the work. Not: the turn that answers a question the user asked; a plan or explanation you were asked for; the session's last turn; plan mode, where making no tool call is required; a question whose answer the transcript shows changed the plan. \`out\` includes thinking, so point at the restated content, not the token shape.
- multi-agent — parallel agents each re-reading the same large file the parent already had; agents with a thin brief (small \`promptChars\`, large \`tokens\`); results never read; agents spawned again after a limit error; mechanical agents on the premium model (\`agent=\` flag shows the resolved model and \`edits\`); the main loop re-reading files or re-running checks an agent's rows already covered, after it returned; a brief that pastes in whole files (large \`promptChars\`) to an agent whose rows then Read the same paths anyway; a workflow whose later agents re-read what earlier agents read (the same Read keys under successive \`agent\` values, spread over turns); a loop whose rows are only checks that passed, with \`edits 0\` and a report as its outcome (AGENTS \`checks\` > 0) — a shell step given a model; review or verify loops with \`edits 0\` whose outcome carries no medium, high or critical finding, recurring stage after stage; two or more verifier loops per finding; a run whose tokens per edit are several times the others'; a fix loop followed by a review whose outcome carries a new high in the same stage, twice (regression chasing: stop the loop and re-plan). Not: agents with disjoint file sets each reading one shared spec; two agents touching one path unless the ledger shows a conflict (an errored edit right after another agent's edit, or a re-edit in the main loop after they returned); a re-read whose brief the transcript shows is a review or verification pass; every agent reading the one spec its brief names; the parent reading an agent's result; one review per stage that found a medium or higher; a loop that edited; a fan-out's breadth on its own.
- environment — installs repeated with no manifest edit; Bash used where Read/Grep/Edit is cheaper; fixed per-turn overhead (memory files, agent descriptions, MCP schemas in the facts line) larger than the work. Not: the user's own denials (\`denied\`); a single approval prompt.
- process — many tiny commits or amends on one change; work declared done with no check run; re-deriving after a compaction what was settled before it. Not: docs- or config-only changes with no check to run, or a check the environment cannot run.
- other — a repetition none of the above names. Name it plainly.

## Never report
- A first occurrence, or anything with fewer than two unexcused occurrences after the Counting rules.
- A single long call that was needed once, however long it ran: the largest row in TIME or CONTEXT is a fact to explain, never a finding on its own.
- Orientation: the first look at any file, directory or log, an unfamiliar area, or a scope the user left open ("audit every call site", "review the repo").
- Parallelism: calls issued together with nothing between them are one decision, and agents on disjoint scopes launched at once are one decision — one, not none: their weight is judged under multi-agent.
- Occurrences a compaction separates, and any re-read a compaction made necessary. Compaction, prompt-cache reads and the host's own truncation are the harness working as designed.
- A denied call (\`denied\`): the user or a policy said no, never your waste. The only reportable version is re-running an unchanged command already declined twice, and then the fix is a \`settings-allow\` proposal, not a rebuke.
- A file change you cannot see: the \`paths\` column records only Edit/Write and Bash calls the host diffed, and nothing for a staged edit. Treat an intervening formatter, codegen, migration, install, \`git checkout|stash|pull|apply\`, \`sed -i\`, MCP edit or another agent's edit as having changed the file.
- Volume alone. A large read is waste only when a cheaper call would have answered the same question for the same purpose; if the output was the deliverable (the diff under review, the log you were asked to explain, a file about to be rewritten) it is not a finding.
- Turns spent thinking on a genuinely hard decision.
- A cue whose evidence is not in these columns (an error message, a file's true size, worktree isolation): if you cannot see it, you cannot evidence it.
- The duration of a \`recovered\` row, or which agent ran it: neither was recorded, and its \`err\` may be a refusal the transcript stored as error text, so treat a \`recovered\` \`err\` row as \`denied\` and never as waste.
- Anything the user asked for this session, however wasteful it looks. Read the transcript before you accuse.

## Confidence
\`confidence\` runs 0.5 to 1.0. 0.9+: the same key three or more times with other work between each, nothing changed between, no request for it in the transcript. 0.7-0.9: the repetition is plain and the transcript offers no legitimate reason. 0.5-0.7: the repetition is real but a legitimate reason is plausible — report here only if you looked for that reason and \`why\` names what rules it out; if it could plausibly have been the right call, drop it. Below 0.5: say nothing.

\`est_tokens_per_turn\`: null whenever \`signature\` is an object. For a null signature it is an integer grounded in the \`answerChars\` of the cited turns divided by four, conservative end, or 0 when you cannot ground it; the user sees it multiplied into a savings figure every turn after a decision. For agent handles it is the tokens one avoided loop would have cost, grounded in AGENTS \`tok\`, conservative end.

\`proposal\`: null unless the fix should outlive the session. Otherwise \`{"kind","title","body"}\` where body is, per kind: \`claude-md\` one imperative rule line; \`skill\` the workflow as the body of a SKILL.md; \`agent-brief\` the brief, whose first line may be \`model: haiku\` or \`model: sonnet\`; \`settings-allow\` nothing but a permission rule such as \`Bash(bun test:*)\`.

## Contract — the shape of your reply, stated once (documentation, not a template to echo)
\`\`\`json
{"focus": "<one line: what this session is doing>",
 "time": "<one sentence, at most 200 chars: where the wall-clock went>",

\`\`\`
\`time\` and \`context\` explain where each went, for the user to read and in the words of the work: "45 min per chunk: the full proxy suite runs after every fix round and each chunk gets two review rounds". Neither is an accusation and neither is a finding by itself, so write both even when \`findings\` is \`[]\` — the examples below leave them out where they are not the point, your reply never does.

\`findings\` may be \`[]\`. \`signature\` is that object or \`null\`. No other keys, and never null where a string is specified. Reply with one JSON object: first character \`{\`, last character \`}\`, no prose before or after, no code fence.

## Examples — evidence, then what it justifies
Rows \`r41\`, \`r45\`, \`r50\` carry \`test:bun test\` in turns 7, 8, 9 while only \`/src/auth.ts\` was edited between them, \`r41\` being the session's baseline run: \`{"focus":"fixing the auth token refresh in /src/auth.ts","findings":[{"id":"execution:full-suite-after-each-edit","category":"execution","kind":"Claude keeps running the whole bun test suite after every single-file edit","evidence":["r45","r50"],"signature":{"tool":"Bash","key":"test:bun test"},"why":"r41 was the baseline and is excused; the suite then ran in full at turns 8 and 9 after single-file edits to /src/auth.ts alone, about a minute and 9.7k characters each. Nothing shared changed, and the user asked for a fix, not full verification.","alternative":"Run only the test files covering the files you changed, then the whole suite once when the phase is done.","confidence":0.92,"est_tokens_per_turn":null,"proposal":{"kind":"claude-md","title":"Targeted tests","body":"Run only the tests covering the files you changed; run the full suite at the end of a phase."}}]}\`
Rows \`r12\` Read \`/src/api.ts:-\`, \`r15\` Edit \`/src/api.ts\`, \`r16\` Read \`/src/api.ts:-\` with \`dedup\`, all in turn 4: \`{"focus":"a one-file change in /src/api.ts","findings":[]}\` — the second read follows your own edit and the third was deduped, so no unexcused occurrence remains.
Rows \`r08\` \`test:bun test\` (turn 2, baseline), \`r23\` \`test:bun test test/db.test.ts\` (turn 6, after an edit), \`r40\` \`test:bun test\` (turn 11) followed by \`r41\` \`git:git commit …\`: \`{"focus":"a db pool fix, verified narrowly then once before the commit","findings":[]}\` — both full runs are excused, so nothing survives the Counting rules.
Rows \`r61\` and \`r72\` both \`read:docker compose logs api --tail 2000\` in turns 11 and 13, each ~40k \`chars\` with \`persist=\`: the same shape as the first example with \`"id":"reading:unfiltered-log-dump"\`, \`"kind":"Claude keeps reading 2000 lines of api logs instead of grepping for the error"\`, \`"alternative":"Pipe log commands through grep -nE 'ERROR|Traceback' and tail -50 instead of reading the whole tail."\`, \`"confidence":0.85\`, \`"proposal":null\`.
TURNS shows turns 14 and 15 with \`calls 0\` and \`answerChars\` 5400 and 6100 after a single edit at turn 13, neither answering a question: \`"id":"communication:restates-plan-each-turn"\`, \`"evidence":["turn:14","turn:15"]\`, \`"signature":null\`, \`"est_tokens_per_turn":1200\`, \`"alternative":"State the result in one or two lines and take the next action; do not restate the plan or recap completed steps."\`.
Rows \`r80\`-\`r83\` under \`agent\` \`a1\` Read four files, then \`r84\` Agent \`agent:general-purpose\` flagged \`agent=general-purpose/opus/completed/41000tok/0edits/300pch\` closes that loop (a spawn row lands after the rows it caused), then \`r90\`-\`r93\` in the main loop Read the same four keys in the next turn: \`"id":"multi-agent:re-reads-what-the-agent-read"\`, \`"kind":"Claude keeps re-reading the files a subagent already read for it"\`, \`"evidence":["r80","r83","r90","r93"]\` (a row from each loop is the repeat; the four main-loop reads together are one batch), \`"signature":null\` (no single key carries it), \`"alternative":"Use the subagent's report; re-read a file it covered only to edit it."\`, \`"confidence":0.8\`, \`"est_tokens_per_turn"\` grounded in the cited turns' \`answerChars\` or 0.
KNOWN PATTERNS lists \`execution:full-suite-after-each-edit | … | steer @ 9\` and rows \`r70\` (turn 12) and \`r76\` (turn 14) carry \`test:bun test\` again: return that same id with \`"evidence":["r70","r76"]\` and a \`why\` that names turns 12 and 14 as after the steer at turn 9.
Agent rows \`r30\`, \`r58\` and \`r91\` run about 40 minutes each, a review agent follows each, every loop reads a different module and no key repeats: \`{"focus":"rewriting three modules, one agent each","time":"2h 40m in three module rewrites of about 40 minutes each, plus one review pass per module; nothing ran twice.","context":"1.1M chars, three quarters of it the agents' own reads of the modules they rewrote.","findings":[]}\` — a long session is not a wasteful one.
Four suite runs with an install or a migration between every pair, and \`agents | ×3 | Σ2100000ms | apart\` above them in TIME: \`{"focus":"a schema migration and the call sites it broke","time":"68m, most of it four suite runs, each after a migration or an install changed what the suite covers.","context":"620k chars, over half the migration diff and the failures it produced.","findings":[]}\` — every repeat had changed inputs, so the ladder stops at nothing.
AGENTS lists \`a3 | w3 | check:C3 | sonnet | 1 | 1.7m | 48k | edits 0 | checks 4 | reads 0 | report 1600ch | answer\` and \`a7 | w3 | check:C4 | …\` alike, and no row of theirs carries \`err\`: \`{"id":"multi-agent:check-loops-for-shell-steps","kind":"Claude keeps spawning an agent per chunk whose only job is to run four passing check commands","evidence":["agent:a3","agent:a7"],"signature":null,"alternative":"Run a stage's checks as a shell step of the workflow script or inside the reviewer; spawn an agent only for work that needs judgment.","confidence":0.85,"est_tokens_per_turn":48000}\`
Three \`review:*\` loops of one run, each \`edits 0\` with outcome \`3 low\`, a fix loop after each: \`{"id":"multi-agent:review-rounds-that-find-only-lows","kind":"Claude keeps running a full review round after every fix although the last two found only low findings","evidence":["agent:a9","agent:a12"],"signature":null,"alternative":"Route only medium-or-higher review findings to a fix round; end the stage when a review returns lows alone.","confidence":0.8}\`

## KNOWN PATTERNS — \`id | kind | decision @ turn | previous\`. Reuse these ids; never mint a second id or signature for waste listed here.
{{KNOWN_PATTERNS}}

## DECISIONS — \`id | key | keep|steer|kill @ turn\`, then previous-session keeps. A \`keep\` key is off limits under any id this session.
{{DECISIONS}}

## STATS — the whole session, counted for you. Per call: \`tool | key | cls | ×count | Σms | Σchars | turns first-last | edits-between | agents\` (edits-between: median number of files edited between consecutive runs; 0 means it re-ran with nothing changed), then \`waits:\` — every AskUserQuestion this session, its total wait and how many carried a recommended default; not citable, but the time it held the session is a fact to explain. Then per class and per agent. No ids here; cite LEDGER rows.
{{STATS}}

## TIME — where the wall-clock went. \`total\`, then \`label | ×count | Σms | share%\` for the largest sinks, then the five longest rows as \`r<seq> | tool | key | Σms\`. An Agent row holds its own loop's rows, so it is listed apart and never added in; \`ms\` includes any wait on a permission prompt.
{{TIME}}

## CONTEXT — where the context went. The same shape measured in \`chars\`: the total, the largest sinks with their share, then the five largest rows. An Agent row is listed apart and never added in.
{{CONTEXT}}

## AGENTS — the loops this session spawned. First one line per run: \`name | id | loops | Σmin | Σtok | edits | turn\`. Then one line per loop, oldest first: \`alias | run | label | model | turns | min | tok | edits | checks | reads | outcome | ended\` — \`alias\` is the LEDGER's \`agent\` name for that loop, \`label\` the stage the workflow gave it (\`impl:C3\`, \`check:C3\`, \`review:C6-r1\`), \`outcome\` what it returned (\`1 high 4 low\`, \`report 5900ch\`), \`ended\` \`answer\`, \`error\`, \`aborted\`, \`refusal\` or \`running\`. \`tok\` counts new tokens (input, cache creation, output) in thousands. Loops older than the window fold into \`~ run | ×loops | Σmin | Σtok\` lines. Cite a loop as \`agent:<alias>\`; a line here is a loop's whole cost, so its weight against its \`edits\` and \`outcome\` is the proportion question's evidence.
{{AGENTS}}

## TURNS — \`turn | in | out | cacheCreate | calls | ms | answerChars\`, then \`| aborted\`, \`| error\` or \`| refusal\` when the turn ended that way and \`| idle <m>m\` when the next prompt came a minute or more later, then the facts line (context window, fixed per-turn overhead, turns where a compaction happened)
{{TURNS}}

## LEDGER — \`id | tool | key | cls | agent | turn | ms | chars | flags | paths\`, oldest first (a spawn row lands after the rows it caused: an agent's own calls finish before its Agent row does). Agents are named \`a1\`, \`a2\`… in order of first appearance; \`main\` is the main loop. \`ms\` is wall time and includes any wait on a permission prompt, so a long \`ms\` alone is not machine cost. A row flagged \`recovered\` was rebuilt from the transcript before this plugin joined the session: its \`ms\` is 0 and its agent reads \`main\`, so never reason about its duration or which loop ran it. flags: \`err\` \`denied\` \`dedup\` \`trunc\` \`bg\` \`timeout\` \`persist=<bytes>\` \`ask\` (an AskUserQuestion: its \`ms\` is the wait for the person) \`recommended\` (its options named a default) \`+adds/-dels\` \`agent=<type>/<model>/<status>/<tokens>tok/<edits>edits/<promptChars>pch\`, or \`-\`. Rows older than the window are folded into \`~ | tool | key | ×count | Σchars\` lines: no id, never citable, key usable as a signature only if it also appears in a full row.
