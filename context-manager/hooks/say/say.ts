/**
 * Which language ContextManager speaks.
 *
 * ## Adding one
 *
 * Three lines, and nothing else in the plugin has to know:
 *
 * 1. `hooks/say/<tag>.ts` — `export const XX: PartialTexts = { … }`, the keys you
 *    have translated and no others. `en.ts` is the shape and the fallback: a key
 *    you leave out is drawn in English, a key you misspell is a compile error.
 * 2. One entry in `LANGUAGES` below.
 * 3. One string in the manifest's `language` options, so `/config` offers it.
 *    That third line is the one duplication, and it is unavoidable: a
 *    `config.describe` hook may rewrite a row's label and help but neither its
 *    kind nor its options, so the menu's list has to be declared.
 *
 * A language that wants the judge's cards in its own words fills `judge.directive`
 * and `judge.kindPrefix` too. Leaving both out is a complete answer: the chrome is
 * translated and the findings keep coming back in English.
 *
 * ## Reading it
 *
 * `sayOf` is pure and is where the rules are. The holder under it exists because
 * every drawing and every reply would otherwise have to carry the bundle down
 * through the view models, the reducer and each pure function's parameters — a
 * language is settled once, before anything is drawn, and never changes for the
 * life of a module: writing the `/config` row reloads the module, which sets it
 * again from the new option.
