/**
 * Every line ContextManager puts in front of a person, in English: the one complete
 * bundle, and the shape every other language is checked against.
 *
 * A language is a file like this one carrying the keys it has translated and no
 * others — `PartialTexts`, not `Texts` — so a half-finished translation ships and
 * falls back to these lines key by key, and a misspelt key is a compile error
 * rather than a blank on screen.
 *
 * A line that takes an argument is a function, never a template assembled at the
 * call site: a sentence's word order and its plural are the translator's business,
 * and a caller that glued two halves together would have decided them for it.
 *
 * What is not here is not translated, on purpose: the glyphs, the product's name,
 * the `/manager` subcommands and every id the model or the store round-trips — a
 * word that is typed or matched may not move with the language.
